# Freelinking Prepopulate

Freelinking Prepopulate provides freelinking plugins that leverage the 
Prepopulate module to link to Drupal form pages that are partially preloaded.

## Createnode
The create node module links to a node/add page. It is used primarily as a 
failover for the Nodetitle plugin.

The 'Target' is treated as a title, and used to preload the node/add form's title 
field. With advanced configuration, it can also preload the currently viewed 
node's taxonomy, book parent, or organic group. These advanced fields only work
when viewing text on a particular node page.

## FL-P Utilities
The Freelinking Prepopulate Utilities are intended to help with the centralized definition
of form fields that may be of interest for Prepopulate-based plugins, and automating
the process of extracting information for such fields.
